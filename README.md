## by Priscilla Ogwa


## Dataset

> This data collection contains information about individual rides taken in a bike-sharing system serving the greater San Francisco Bay area. This data can be found at https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1659381788715592&usg=AOvVaw1Rb_cb8_sZilDL5WO_RJTV

> After data wrangling there are 174952 bikes in the dataset with 13 features including: 
> 1. duration_sec
> 2. start_time
> 3. end_time
> 4. start_station_id
> 5. start_station_name
> 6. end_station_id
> 7. end_station_name
> 8. bike_id
> 9. user_type
> 10. bike_share_for_all_trip
> 11. member_birth_year
> 12. member_age
> 13. member_gender


## Summary of Findings

> Members range in age from 21 to 144 years. There are 2 user type customer and subscriber and 3 genders male, female and others. All users appeared to start their trip in February 2019.

> The average journey duration was 10 minutes, and the majority of trips started on Thursdays.

> Male users made up 74.6 percent of all users, and subscribers made up 91% of all users.

> Customers who did not clearly identify their gender travelled the farthest.

> A customer from Generation Z who is not clearly gendered could make the longest trip.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I use the bar plots of duration to show its distrubution, then using a point plot I showed the relationship between member age and duration travelled. User type and generation, are covered afterwards, using heatmap chart and bar plot.
